# assignment-node-frontend
This is the frond end files for a crud project created with html, css, bootstrap and jquery.

The backend files are present in the repo - assignment-node, that has all the methods defined for the backend stuff.

You can simply run the front end files from a local folder, but it is prefered to run the front end also on http-server (can be downloaded via npm).

Thanks..
